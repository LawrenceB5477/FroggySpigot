# FroggyPlugin 
A plugin that has various useful commands. 

It's main command is configcomand, which is an itemspawner 
based on the config.yml file. You can also set what items you 
want the command to spawn in game, but it will not save after 
a server restart. To change the default item, edit the config.yml.
